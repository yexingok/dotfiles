## Keep some notes：

# To let WSL access service on win10, do the following (need admin on win10 workstation)

# 1.Get the win10 host WSL network card IP address, ie: 192.168.240.1

ipconfig 

# 2.Allow WSL to access all win10 host ports

# New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "WSL" -Direction Inbound  -InterfaceAlias "vEthernet (WSL)"  -Action Allow
# Use below to allow the WSL ip network range:
# in WSL2 hosts, get source ip
ip addr 
# Use the source ip range: ie: 172.30.190.134/20 on https://www.sojson.com/convert/subnetmask.html to get the network range, in this case, it is: 172.30.176.0
# on win10, run ipconfig to get the win10 WSL network card IP, in this case, it should be 172.30.176.1, which is the first IP from WSL network, result match each other.
# run below to allow the IP range from firewall, it should work permanently.

New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "WSL-允许WSL网段访问主机服务" -Description "允许WSL网段访问宿主机" -Direction Inbound -Action Allow -RemoteAddress 172.30.176.0/20

# 3.Add port forwarding for firewall
# This allow the WSL host use 192.168.240.1:1081 to access the win10 local port: 127.0.0.1:1081 

netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenaddress=192.168.240.1 listenport=1081 connectaddress=127.0.0.1 connectport=1081 

# 4. verify the forwarding rule has been added with

netsh interface portproxy show v4tov4

侦听 ipv4:                 连接到 ipv4:

地址            端口        地址            端口
--------------- ----------  --------------- ----------
172.29.80.1      1081        127.0.0.1       1081

# 5. remove the previous rule with

netsh interface portproxy delete v4tov4 listenport=1081 listenaddress=172.29.80.1

## if you need to let local network access the WSL2 ports, do following as admin permission:

First, you will need to open a port in your machine to be able to access it from your network.

netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Allow LAN connections to port 5000" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=5000 # assume 5000 is the port you want to open

After you open the port (5000 in my case) you will need to make port forwarding from this port to the port that your app is listening on in the WSL2.

netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenaddress=0.0.0.0 listenport=5000 connectaddress=localhost connectport=<the port that your app is listening on>
